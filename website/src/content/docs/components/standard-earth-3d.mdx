## Usage
### Basic Earth model
Basic render of the Earth3D model. The radius and the base map or the render texture can be altered.
You can also provide your own base, specular and normal maps to the model.

<Earth3DExample/>

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Earth3D, Earth3DGSON } from "@zephyr3D/react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";


export const Earth3DExample = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white/5 h-72">
      <Canvas>
        <ambientLight />
        <directionalLight intensity={1} position={[2, -2, 2]} />
        <Earth3D textureType={"base"} />
        <OrbitControls />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Adding earth animations
The rotation animations can be added by using the `withAnimations` prop.
